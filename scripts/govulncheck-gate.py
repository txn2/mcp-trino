"""Judge a govulncheck JSON report against a list of accepted findings.

govulncheck has no way to accept a finding, and it exits 3 for "your code
calls a vulnerable symbol" whether or not a fixed version exists. When an
advisory lands against a dependency with no patched release, that leaves two
bad options: turn the scan off, or leave every build red. This gate is the
third: accept named advisories, with a written reason, and refuse to let the
acceptance drift out of date.

Only findings that reach a function we call are judged, which is the same set
govulncheck's own "Your code is affected by N vulnerabilities" counts. A
vulnerability in a module we require but never call is reported by govulncheck
and ignored here, exactly as govulncheck already treats it.

It exits 1 when:
  1. A called finding is not listed in the allow file.
  2. A listed advisory now names a fixed version. Upgrade instead of accepting.
  3. A listed advisory is no longer reported. The line is stale.

The last two are what stop an acceptance from outliving its reason.

Allow-file format: one advisory id, whitespace, then the reason it is
accepted. Lines starting with `#` are comments.

Usage: govulncheck-gate.py PATH_TO_REPORT [PATH_TO_ALLOW_FILE]
where PATH_TO_REPORT holds the output of `govulncheck -format json ./...`.

Ported unchanged from txn2/mcp-data-platform.
